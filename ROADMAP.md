# Roadmap

## v0.2

* Add a FILE-OPEN key: a node buffer will be a file name, and pressing a key on the node opens it in users' preferred app
* Scaling the graph to zoom in or out
* Add cursor for buffers so users can use arrow keys to edit specific parts of text

## v0.3

* Search
* Undo
* Add copy, paste functionality for buffers
