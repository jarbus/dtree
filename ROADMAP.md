# Roadmap

## v0.3

* Add a FILE-OPEN key: a node buffer will be a file name, and pressing a key on the node opens it in users' preferred app
* Add clipboard copy, paste functionality for buffers
* Better drawing so the nodes at the top of the graph aren't crazy far apart

## v0.4

* Search

## v0.5
* Undo
